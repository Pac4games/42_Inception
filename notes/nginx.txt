To generate a TSL v1.3 certificate:
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout [key outfile name] -out [cert. outfile name] -days [num] -nodes
{
	req: create a certificate signing request;
	-x509: this makes the certificate self-signed, meaning it's for personal uses only;
	-newkey rsa:4096: generates a new RSA private key with a size of 4096 bits;
	-keyout: estabilishes the name of the outfile for the key;
	-out: estabilishes the name of the outfile for the certificate;
	-days: specifies the number of days this certificate is valid for after its creation;
	-nodes: specifies the key should not be encrypted with a password;

	// The keys found in the "Certificates" folder were generated with a 3650 validity for
	// testing purposes.
}
