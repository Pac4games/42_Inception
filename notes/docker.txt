Pulling new Docker images:
docker pull [image name]

Note that you can always use a container's ID instead of its name when passing it as an argument
to a command.

Creating a new container:
docker run -dt --name [container name] [image name]
{
	-d: run the container in the background and print its ID;
	-t: allocate a pseudo-TTY, enabling I/O for command execution;
}


Deleting an existing container:
docker rm [container name]

Starting a container:
docker start [container name]

Stopping a container:
docker stop [container name]

Running a command inside a container:
docker exec -it [container name] [command]
{
	// Note that to enable a shell with this command you will need to pass a shell as the
	// [command] parameter, such as "bash".

	-i: keep STDIN open even if not attached, allowing to send input;
	-t: same as "docker run";
}

Copying files into a container:
docker cp [src path] [container name]:[dst path]
{
	// The container does not need to be running for this operation
}
