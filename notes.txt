Pulling new docker images:
docker pull [image name]

Creating a new container:
docker run -dt --name [container name] [image name]
{
	-d: run the container in the background and print its ID;
	-t: allocate a pseudo-TTY, enabling I/O for command execution;
}

Running an already existing container:
docker exec -it [container name] [command]
{
	// Note that to enable a shell with this command you will need to pass a shell as the
	// [command] parameter, such as "bash".

	-i: keep STDIN open even if not attached, allowing to send input;
	-t: same as "docker run";
}
